  - name: service_layer
    description: >
      Consider you're dealing with sensitive data (e.g.: PII), that is only available to your team and very selected few individuals, 
      in the raw layer of your DWH (e.g: a specific BigQuery dataset or PostgreSQL schema),
      Among other things, you decide to obfuscate/masquerade that data through your staging models, 
      and make it available in a different schema (a staging layer) for other Data/Analytics Engineers to explore
      And optionally, yet another layer (service layer), where you'll build your dimension (dim_) and fact (fct_) tables 
      (assuming the Star Schema dimensional modeling) for Dashboarding and for Tech Product Owners/Managers
    arguments: 
      - name: model_type
        type: string
        description: >
